# DS210 Final Project

## Description

This project computes the average vertex degree distributions on an ego-net (social network) graph dataset of Twitch streamers. Specifically, I am finding the average vertex degree of a streamer who plays multiple games versus a streamer who only plays one game. The vertex degree refers to the number of other vertices one is connected to.

## Installation

The GitHub repository does not contain the original SNAP dataset files because they are too large. It can be downloaded from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_ego_nets.html to run the program.
